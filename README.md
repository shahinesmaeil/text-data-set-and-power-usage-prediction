data science project final 
Assignment 1: Text data set (compulsory)
Predict the class of Edgar Allan Poe â€˜s poems.

Perform the following steps in a Jupyter notebook and provide your comments, justifications on the outcome for each of the steps towards end objective of creating a good fit model to predict the class of each poem.

1.	Preliminary descriptive statistics, example:
a.	Determine the frequency of each word in the collection
b.	Determine the strongest correlations among words
c.	Word frequencies per class etc.

2.	Feature engineering
a.	Stop words, stemming, feature selection, etc.
b.	Transformation to bag of words, n-grams, etc.

3.	Model fitting
a.	Fit a decision tree model to predict the target variable and display the confusion matrix


Assignment 2:     Power usage and temperature (time series)
Predict power usage in the future

1.	a. Preliminary descriptive statistics

b. Analyse the time series in terms of trend, seasonality and residuals.

c. Analyse the autocorrelation of the time series.

d. Fit a model to predict the power usage for the period of a month at a weekly resolution based on a previous usage. 

2.	Like the previous tasks, please provide the explanation, justification for each step in a Jupyter notebook along with the code.

3.	Optional: Use the temperature data to improve the model fit.
Hint! Use the exogenous parameter of SARIMAX to create the model and to make the predictions using more features.
